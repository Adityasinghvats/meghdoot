# Meghdoot
- Meghdoot is a portable and local weather station, powered by solar energy that solves the problem of collecting localised and ground based weather data for weather prediction.
- The system automatically trains the model with the new data collected through sensors for even more accuracy going forward.
- Easily accessible through out frontend dashboard on web and mobile.

# Business Model kya hain fir ?
- This device can me offered as a low cost alternative to big, bulky and expensive weather stations.
- Any farmer or business dependent on weather conditions can purchase our product.

# Is project me different kya hain ? ðŸ¤”
- Realtime data from BMP280 sensor using ESP32, connected to my sensor server via Internet.
- Realtime weather prediction using ML model, data shown on dashboard in realtime.
- More sensors can be added and built into a hardware product.
- Cloud based data collection and processing, so that the field device can operate on minimum possible power source.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
